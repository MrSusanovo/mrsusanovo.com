			<p class="intro"> That's me at the Similing Buddha's open mic, Toronto. December 23rd, 2016.</p>

			<p class="intro"> About this website. The Design was inspired by Nicholas Allan Cope. </p>
			<p class="intro"> The above picture is one of his masterpiece. Click it.</p>
			<p class="intro"> His personal site was kinda shocking to me. It is more than well-designed.</p>
			<p class="intro"> Only one page with a main menu, displaying his works in a totally black background.</p>
			<p class="intro"> Shocked by a sense of narrative, I applied his pattern on this site.</p>
			<p class="intro"> It is really a naive approach. For Nicholas, his pictrues was everything. Any other "design" can only make it worse.</p>
			<p class="intro"> But I have NOTHING here LOL.</p>
