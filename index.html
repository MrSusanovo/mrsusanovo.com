      <h1>This is a test page</h1>
      <p>Hi, whoever visiting this page. I'm looking for help, to develop this website better.</p></br>
      <p>This domain is hosted on a unbunt 16 lts envrionment by apache2. I want to construct some dynamic webpages with Django here.</p></br>
      <p>Currently ,this page's url is handled by apache2 directly.</p></br>
      <p>But any url that ought to be handled by mod_wsgi currently are 404.</p></br>
      <p>The urls works fine if I do "python manage.py runserver ip:8080", they are accessible via "ip:8080/admin" or "ip:8080/home/index". But they are not valid via mrsusanovo.com/admin or mrsusanovo.com/home/index</p></br>
      <p>If you have any sugesstion or willing to discuss with me, either mail to mr.susanovo@gmail.com, or go to StackOverFlow search for "Apache2 host, url not served with mod_wsgi"</p></br>
      <p> Thank you very much!</br>
