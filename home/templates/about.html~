    <p class="intro"> About this website. The Design was inspired by Nicholas Allan Cope. </p>
    <p class="intro"> The above picture is one of his masterpiece.</p>
    <p class="intro"> His personal site was kinda shocking to me. It is more than well-designed.</p>
    <p class="intro"> Only one page with a main menu, displaying his works in a totally black background.</p>
    <p class="intro"> Shocked by a sense of narrative, I applied his pattern on this site.</p>
    <p class="intro"> It is really a naive approach. For Nicholas, his pictrues was everything.</p>
    <p class="intro">Any other "design" would only make it worse.</p>
    <p class="intro"> But I have NOTHING here LOL.</p>
